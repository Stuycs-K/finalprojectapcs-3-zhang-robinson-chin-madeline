### 2025-05-16 - Worked on Proposals
Robinson and I brainstormed ideas for games in class and worked on the short description/scope. He added it to the repo when he got home.  

### 2025-05-19 - Worked on Prototype
In class we discussed the direction of our project and what we wanted/needed to have. We discussed
the different classes and organization we wanted and how we would implement 
different ideas. When I got home, I spent a few hours typing out the 
technical details, the project design, the UML diagram (done in 
markdown), and the basic outline for our game and methods.  

### 2025-05-20 - Worked on Prototype
Talked with Robinson about work delegation and a general timeline in class. He added 
it to the repo later on.
