### 2025-05-16 - Worked on Proposals
Robinson and I brainstormed ideas for games in class and worked on the short description/scope. He added it to the repo when he got home.  

### 2025-05-19 - Worked on Prototype
In class we discussed the direction of our project and what we wanted/needed to have. We discussed
the different classes and organization we wanted and how we would implement 
different ideas. When I got home, I spent a few hours typing out the 
technical details, the project design, the UML diagram (done in 
markdown), and the basic outline for our game and methods.  

### 2025-05-20 - Worked on Prototype
Talked with Robinson about work delegation and a general timeline in class. He added 
it to the repo later on.

### 2025-05-23 - Revised outline and UML Diagram
Talked with Mr. K about how our project will realistically function 
and made edits to the outline and methods. When I got home, I remade 
the UML diagram (on a proper website) with the changes in methodology. 

### 2025-05-27 - Began work on the classes/basics.
In class, Robinson added all the individual classes/subclasses and 
I started on the general setup of Game (like the checkered board and the 2D
array for the pieces). When I got home, I instated the abstract Piece class
with the basic methods and worked on the allowedMoves for Rook, Queen, and 
King (took around 2 hours, including the time it took to work out how I wanted the classes
to connect with one another other so they would work properly).  

### 2025-05-28 - Began work on castling.
Robinson and I agrued over the division of work and how to split the classes 
in class today. When I got home, I stuggled on castling for like two hours 
before I got something that might work. 

### 2025-05-28 - Worked on more castling and restricting king movements.
I continued to work on my castling logic before I rudely discovered 
that the rook cannot initiate the castling. I deleted a lot of the 
unecessary code and did my best to clean things up. Then, I began to work on 
making sure the king could not move in a way that would put itself into 
check by modifying allowedMoves and adding a helper method. This all took ~2-3 
hours because I was quite confused and don't really know how to play chess.
