2025-05-16 - Worked on Proposals
Maddie and I brainstormed ideas for games in class and worked on the short description/scope and I spent an hour adding it to the repo when I got home.

2025-05-19 - Worked on Prototype
In class we discussed the direction of our project and what we wanted/needed to have. We discussed the different classes and organization we wanted and how we would implement different ideas. When she got home, she spent a few hours typing out the technical details, the project design, the UML diagram (done in markdown), and the basic outline for our game and methods.

2025-05-20 - Worked on Prototype
Talked with Maddie about work delegation and a general timeline in class and I spent around an hour adding it to the repo at home.

2025-05-27- Empty day (around 30 minutes)
My internet had crashed so I couldn't git pull, although I talked with Maddie about changing the responsibilities so she could continue working.

2025-05-28- Coding and arguing (around 2.5 hours)
Maddie and I argued in class about some miscommuncation and where check and checkmate methods should be. Afterwards I worked on pawn and knight using pawn as a framework for knight.
 
2025-05-29 Bishop class (2 hours)
Maddie and I were discussing the special casses in class, and I gave her misleading information on how castling was initiated, I was also told I needed to draw the board, I had forgotten to do so. 
At home I worked on the Bishop class for around 40 minutes then around an hour twenty to get the pieces to be placed and move on the board before I was too tired to continue and I took an hour nap that took 7 hours.

2025-05-30 to 06-02 (6 hours)
On friday in class me and Maddie discussed what we had to do while fixing some errors and bugs in the code. (~ 30 minutes). Was not able to work on Saturday due to a personal situation. Sunday slept in and started working on the first iteration of the pawn enpassant and capture (~1.5 hours). I got the pawn captureing to work (~30 minutes) and enpassant to work (~1 hour). Then I focused on my pawn promotion, at first the logic was correct but the board didn't update so I changed the method. (~1 hour) Then I realized the problem was in the game file so I started to work my way through the code eventually finding the source of the bug and fixing it (~1 hour). Then I picked up where Maddie left off and worked on the Checkmate and stalemate methods completing both. (~1.5 hours)
