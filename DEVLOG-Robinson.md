2025-05-16 - Worked on Proposals
Maddie and I brainstormed ideas for games in class and worked on the short description/scope and I spent an hour adding it to the repo when I got home.

2025-05-19 - Worked on Prototype
In class we discussed the direction of our project and what we wanted/needed to have. We discussed the different classes and organization we wanted and how we would implement different ideas. When she got home, she spent a few hours typing out the technical details, the project design, the UML diagram (done in markdown), and the basic outline for our game and methods.

2025-05-20 - Worked on Prototype
Talked with Maddie about work delegation and a general timeline in class and I spent around an hour adding it to the repo at home.

2025-05-27- Empty day (around 30 minutes)
My internet had crashed so I couldn't git pull, although I talked with Maddie about changing the responsibilities so she could continue working.

2025-05-28- Coding and arguing (around 2.5 hours)
Maddie and I argued in class about some miscommuncation and where check and checkmate methods should be. Afterwards I worked on pawn and knight using pawn as a framework for knight.
 
2025-05-29 Bishop class (2 hours)
Maddie and I were discussing the special casses in class, and I gave her misleading information on how castling was initiated, I was also told I needed to draw the board, I had forgotten to do so. 
At home I worked on the Bishop class for around 40 minutes then around an hour twenty to get the pieces to be placed and move on the board before I was too tired to continue and I took an hour nap that took 7 hours.
