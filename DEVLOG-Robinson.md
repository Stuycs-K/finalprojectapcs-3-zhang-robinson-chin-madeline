Maddie and I brainstormed ideas for games in class and worked on the short description/scope and I spent an hour adding it to the repo when I got home.

In class we discussed the direction of our project and what we wanted/needed to have. We discussed the different classes and organization we wanted and how we would implement different ideas. When she got home, she spent a few hours typing out the technical details, the project design, the UML diagram (done in markdown), and the basic outline for our game and methods.
