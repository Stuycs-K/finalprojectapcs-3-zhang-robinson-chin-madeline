# Technical Details:

We will be using an overall Game class for the actual playing (this is also where edge cases will
be handled, such as castling), with an abstract subclass called Piece. Under Piece, 
we will have individual subclasses for each chess piece (King, Queen, etc.) to establish each piece's 
unique moves and edge cases. A 2D array will be used to keep track of the chess board and moves the players
make, using knowledge from labs such as N-Queens to understand possible moves and positions.
     
# Project Design

PERIOD 3  
Maddie Chin and Robinson Zhang  
A Rooky Mistake  
Brief Project description: Chess played according to the standardized rules on an 
8x8 board. Two players will take turns moving one of their pieces (king, queen, rook, 
bishop, knight, or pawn) to an appropriate spot. The game will include correct 
movement mechanics and capturing rules, including edge cases (such as how a pawn can 
move two spaces on its first move or castling). The game will end when some player 
checkmates the otherâ€™s king with no possible way to escape. If possible during the time 
frame, we would also like to implement the additional features to make the regular chess 
into boom chess, including the ability to skip a turn to blow up a random square on the 
board.

Outline:
1. Game
	- initiates board
	- starts game with one player's turn
	- allows the player to move one piece (according to the type) to a valid space before switching turns
	- moves continue according to whose turn it is
	- checks if the game has reached a checkmate and determines a winner
2. Piece (abstract)
	- basis for all pieces
	- includes row and col according to location on the board
	- checks for preexisting piece in a certain square/coordinates
	- checks if player is allowed to move to a certain square/place on the board (will replace preexisting piece)
3. Pawn
	- piece can move one space forward at a time
	- if a piece is located in a forward diagonal, it may capture and move there; otherwise, it may not move diagonally
	- change to Queen piece when reaching he other end of the board is handled as an edge case in Game 
4. Rook
	- can move down rows or columns
	- castling handled in Game
5. Knight
	- can move in L shapes (two spaces one direction and one in a perpendicular direction to the first)
6. Bishop 
	- can move diagonally on the board
7. Queen 
	- can move in all directions
8. King 
	- can move in all directions, but only one space at a time
    
# Intended pacing:
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

Robinson: 
1. Board Setup
   - Setup a 8 by 8 board as a 2D array
   - Place all pieces in starting positions
   - Work on abstract Piece class

2. Pawn
   - One space forward
   - Two spaces on first move
   - Diagonal capture
   - Enpassant
   - Pawn Promotion
     
3. Knight
   - L shaped movement and capture
   - Can jump over pieces
     
4. Bishop
   - Diagonal Movement and capture

Maddie:
1. Logic
   - Work on check and checkmate logic
   - Check for legal and illegal moves
   - Castling 
     
2. Rook
   - Horizontal and vertical movement and capture

3. Queen
   - Combination of Rook and Bishop movement and capture

4. King
   - One square in any direction and capture
   - Can't put themselves in check/checkmate

Shared: 
   - Play though the game
       - Legal and illegal moves
       - Capturing
       - Turn swithcing
  - Debug
  - Clean up redudant code
  - Add comments throughout the coding process
  - Prepare demo and walkthrough for presentation

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

Phase 1: Setup and planning (May 21)
  - Finalize decision on which game to code
  - Assign roles and responsibilities
  - Set up Github Repo and Branches

Phase 2: Core game framework (May 28)
  - Initialize 8 by 8 board with all pieces
  - Turn tracking implmentation
  - Code Piece abstract class
  - Moves for all pieces:
    	- Pawn: single/double movement and diagonal capture
    	- Knight: L shaped movment and capture, jumping over pieces
    	- Bishop: Diagonal movement and capture
    	- Rook: Vertical and horizontal movement and capture
    	- Queen: 8 direction movement
    	- King: 1 step all directions     
    
Phase 3: Rules and edge cases (May 30)
  - Castling
  - En passent
  - Pawn Promotion
  - King can't move into check and has to be saved from check
  - Check detection and checkmate detection
    
Phase 4: Testing and Polishing (June 1)
  - Play through the game to catch bugs
  - Test:
      - Legal and illegal moves
      - Check/checkmate logic
      - Switching and capturing
      - Any UI tweaks
  - Prepare demo and presentation
