# IDEAS:

1 Boom Chess
Description:
        Boom Chess will be a twist on classic Chess. Players will take turn moving pieces (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn) according to standard chess rules. The game will end when one player checkmates the other's king. The twist will be that at anytime you or your opponent can skip their turn to randomly explode a square on the 8 by 8 grid and if that square has a piece it'll be removed, with the exception of the King as if its square is exploded you or your opponent wins. This explosion will be indiscriminate meaning you can also explode your own piece. 
        
Scope: 
       Core chess gameplay without AI, Interface will allow for piece movement, highlight valid moves, track turns, tracks win conditions, and have a button for a random explosion.
