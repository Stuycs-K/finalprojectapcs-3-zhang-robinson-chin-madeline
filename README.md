# Project Description

 Chess played according to the standardized rules on an 8x8 board. Two players will take turns moving one of their pieces (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, or pawn) to an appropriate spot. The game will include correct movement mechanics and capturing rules, including edge cases (such as how a pawn can move two spaces on its first move or castling). The game will end when some player checkmates the otherâ€™s king with no possible way to escape. ~~If possible during the time frame, we would also like to implement the additional features to make the regular chess into boom chess, including the ability to skip a turn to blow up a random square on the board.~~ (no time :[)  

# Intended usage:

Background is the standard 8x8 checkered board and graphics for pieces. There will be a prompt for the input of algebraic chess notation to move the pieces, with a running record of the moves made during the game. The main purpose of the game is to be fun and easily used.
